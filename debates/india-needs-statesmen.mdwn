title: India Needs Statesmen, Not Politicians
---

India is a vast country, vast in area, population, and cultural and
lingual diversity. Probably the only thing that keeps us together is
that we are all Indians. But to shape and keep together this country, it
has taken the work of many able statesmen.

A great percentage of our population is mostly illiterate. Thus a major
segment of the people are incapable of managing more than their personal
business. Until that situation changes, the country must be governed by
individuals ready to think in terms of the country and he masses. We
need people who can ignore the demands of one, or a few, in light of the
needs of all. After all, the needs of many, outweigh the needs of the
few. We need people who are statesmen in the truest sense of the world.

Our Constitution guarantees the equality of all citizens and the right
to vote and also to stand for election. These rights are noble ones, and
ones to be safeguarded. But still, every person who wants power and a
government office cannot be elected. We cannot silently hand over the
rein of power to mere politicians who will work to better a small
section of the populace; while the rest of society silently crumbles.
Such people will only divert resources to one place while the needs of
others are ignored. They are like the man-made canals which bring water
to the fields to cultivate certain crops, risking the death of the flora
of the rest of land. But what we direly need are the rivers that wash
all the land and bring equal life to rose bushes, to fruit trees and to
weeds. 

We need statesmen, people who will not see if a person belongs to a
scheduled caste or not; who will not care if a person supports communism
or does not; but will make sure that every last man gets his bread and
water and that they work justly for it. We need people who are morally
and intellectually strong. People who will rob themselves and give to
the poor if need be, but who will never do things the other way. We need
people who line the coffers of the nation, but not their own.

We need statesmen, men for others, not politicians. A politician would
strive to uplift himself and the particular cause he supports. But
statesmen strive to uplift all causes, as long as they are just and
true. We need statesmen today to lift India from it's turmoil both
political and social.
