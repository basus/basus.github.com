title: The world is a comedy

The world is a comedy to those who think and a tragedy to those who
feel. 

As humans we are supposed to be intelligent creatures. We are supposed
to analyze and ultimately understand our surroundings. If we truly can
understand, then we will understand that today’s world is certainly
not a bed of roses. In fact, today’s world is quite the opposite, a
bed of thorns, if I may. However that’s not to say that all those who
can think and understand are doomed. But they can’t instantly separate
themselves from the pains of the world either. We don’t just think we
feel as well. Man is a moral animal. We feel not just for our kin or
those close to us, we feel for the suffering of people anywhere. As a
result it is impossible for any of us to say boldly and with consummate
conviction that “I don’t care for the pains of the world. The
happenings of the world do not touch me.” If any of us can say so,
then it is a symbol of selfishness, a symbol of escapism. Not of
thought. 

How many of us can look at all the people dying in the wars, at all the
beggars and destitutes on the roads, at all the people working day and
night for a scrap of food and just laugh out loud, thinking it to be
nothing but a mere joke. For those who feel the world is indeed a
tragedy, a great one, far more powerful and moving than anything
Shakespeare could have ever written. But for those who think, the world
is still a tragedy, maybe a lesser one, maybe one that can be improved,
but a tragedy none the less. If we think we can change that tragedy and
make things just a little bit better for those who are a part of it, if
we feel, then we can only sympathize with and console those who suffer.
But even then, our thoughts, our feelings are driven by the desire to
help people. Great scientists and scholars, people to whom we owe many
marvels of modern technology, did what they did to help man in some way
or the other. If they felt the world was a joke, they would not have had
any such desire. If we cannot dispute that such people thought and
thought greater things than any of us here, then how can we say, that
the world is a comedy for those who think? Respected chairperson judges
and dear friends, I leave the question to you.
