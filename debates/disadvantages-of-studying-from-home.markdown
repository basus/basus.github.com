title: The Disadvantage of Studying from Home
--- 

  Our world is one of computers, technology, instant
  communications and easy access to information. But it is also a
  world of growing anti-social activities, disillusioned youth and
  broken families. In a world where more than half of the number
  of marriages end in divorce, and where a growing number of
  families have more than one working parent, should the present
  school system be declared obsolete? This question must be
  answered in the context of modern society upon which it will
  have profound and long-lasting consequences.

  The school is not merely a storehouse of facts and information.
  Students do not go to school simply learn facts and figures
  about the world. If that were the case, they would have been
  sent to libraries, not school. In the future, the social role
  of the school will become more important.
