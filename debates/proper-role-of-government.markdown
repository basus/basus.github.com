Crito went to visit Socrates in the dungeon where the great scholar was
held for not complying with the laws of the ‘government’ of Athens1.
After the usual greetings, Crito proceeded to tell Socrates that he had
organized a plan for Socrates to escape from the dungeon and from
eventual death. But Socrates declared that he shall never do such a
thing. His decision was based upon the philosophical question : “What
would happen if everybody did that ?” The argument of Socrates was
that if he, a great scholar with a large following, decides to disobey
the order that his ‘government’ has laid upon him, then it may
compel his followers to do the same - ultimately resulting the fall of
the ‘government’ of Athens. What is this ‘government’ that
seemed such worshippable to Socrates?  

In various economic and political literature Government is described
somewhat as a single sovereign agency over a certain geographical area
responsible for maintaining its territorial boundaries, for imparting
physical security to the people of the land, for acting as an agent for
economic development and for providing its people with social
opportunities. Though the idea of  ‘government’ is not exclusively
attached with that of the ‘democracy’, in the present context we may
allow that to happen. As it is rather fatuous to talk about the
‘proper role’ of the government in the case of the forms of
government other than democratic. The autocratic leaders or similar
authoritative ones would rather love to point out the society’s
‘proper role’, instead of bothering about their own ‘proper
role’.

Let us study the inter-relations of the government and the society in
the Indian context. Before the coming of the Europeans, the human mass
inhabiting the Indian subcontinent was largely divided into numerous
close-knit communities headed by authorities selected by various local
processes (the richest man, the strongest man, the wisest man, the
holiest man ...). These divisions between the communities were usually
based upon religious or ethnic roots. The various communities were
economically well linked, though rarely nuptially. The daily social life
was largely devoid of the shadow of the governmental processes : the
wise-old people were asked to handle the social conflicts of the
community. The same men visited the court of the king in cases of
collective appeals to the ruler. Thus the society seldom felt the
presence of the all-powerful government except in the incidents of
battles. The inter-kingdom battles were one of the greater dooms in the
life of these communities. As the old Bengali saying goes, ‘the kings
do war, the common man sheds the blood’.     

Largely because of the similar economic and social status of the people
living in these communities, the individual self was very much near to
the collective self, thus decreasing the government’s role in the life
of an individual and increasing the role of the society. On the other
hand, the lack of governmental presence in individual life ruled out the
possibility of few man’s rebellion against the society and gave the
society a free hand to oppress the poorer sections of the community in
the interest of a small elite section, thus stabilizing the society’s
control over the public life at the cost of a gradual collective moral
downslide.

1857 AD onwards, under the ruling rod of the British Empire, the mass
leaders realised that a feeling of ‘nationality’ is essential to
arouse the people of the land against the British. Hence born the
concept of India the state. Started the process of molding out a
‘national identity’ often by force, by extrapolation of historical
facts and by active gerrymandering of the boundaries of the individual
and the collective selves – the two celebrated entities of the
yesteryears. 

At this period, the time witnessed the rise of the new Indian elite. He
is usually Brahmin (though a few exceptions do exist). He has definitely
received education in the west (most of them were lawyers). For some
unknown reasons he is convinced that the British Empire would hand over
him the sovereignty of his land that is, India if he continues to hold
round table conversations with them. And lastly but most importantly he
has simply assumed that it is his duty to speak for the zillions of
illiterates of his land. Surprisingly, only few were interested in
actually making at least some of these zillions literate. So the freedom
rebellions of India were largely manipulated by a close-knit group of
thinkers with a huge mass almost blindly following them. Thus India
found freedom, murdering the freedom of the individual thought except
that of a select class, which virtually drove the collective
aspirations.

This could have been the dying bed of individual right in Indian
subcontinent. Fantastically it was not. 

Since 1947 AD, the collective picture of the society of independent
India shows a rapid acceleration of the conflict between an old
civilization and the way of working of a globalized multicultural
society. The civilisation, after developing through ages an intricate
design to contain numerous ‘little volumes’ of localized tradition
and morality in its own ‘great volume’ of tradition and morality,
suddenly found itself populated by a human mass driven by a
‘khichdi’ of rationality, consumerism, utilitarianism,
post-modernism and what-not ism’s. It is like forcing an iron chain to
be sewn into an existing tapestry, which is already losing the count of
its loose ends. This brings us to the question of whether a culture and
its members, thus forming an important building unit of a multicultural
society, can retain their individualistic identity when leaving their
destiny in the hands of a centralized government?

Not only in the case of India but throughout the history of
civilisation, the institution of government and the principle of the
social order have been intertwined in an often conflicting, sometimes
harmonious, relationship. An examination of this delicate connection
makes us wonder about what can be the proper role of government in a
society. But to answer that, we must first understand why the government
is needed and whether it should be present at all. Then we can proceed
to define the roles of the government in a manner that satisfies us all.

The factor that separates a government from any other civic or social
organization is that the governments may legally use physical force to
make its citizen with its demands2. Nothing and nobody else may do this.
Not you, not me, not the fundamental groups, not the non-fundamental
groups, not your neighborhood bird-watching club, not ANYBODY – except
government. Only government has this power to legitimize the use of
force. The use of force by any other body will be legal only if the
government says so. But the role government is not that of one legal
bully. It possesses such exclusive power for a simple purpose  –  to
provide its citizen with civil-security and social-opportunity. 

Often it is stated that to offer civil-security and social-opportunity a
government must first induce economic stability into the society. So let
us see what things are said about the role of government in economy. In
the modern world, the role of government in economy draws upon the works
of Adam Smith and his book The Wealth of Nations, and on the work of
John Keynes. Out of the writings of these two men, modern governments
have accepted four basic economic roles in society:

To encourage and support a competitive market system of production 

To provide for public goods and/or services – goods and/or services
which are valuable and will not be produced in a market system 

To reduce the swings in the economic business cycle 

To encourage and provide charity for those less fortunate 

The first role of government according to Smith is to create a climate
where individuals could enter voluntarily into agreements with others to
produce, distribute and consume products with minimal government
direction or interference. The government was to encourage a competitive
climate and to support the system through appropriate regulation. To
that end, the first role of government is to enforce contracts through a
system of justice and police, and to control the growth of monopolies,
which can suppress a competitive system.

The second role of government is to provide for public goods, like the
defense of a nation in war, and the provision of health related
services. Adam Smith recognized that certain goods and services would
not be produced in a free market economy. The government would need to
produce these goods because they are necessary for society to function,
and provided valuable benefits to society. For a variety of reasons
society has gone well beyond what Adam Smith would have thought about in
those days. Communities have started to invest on their own in such
things as schools, hospitals…, which will benefit them in the long
run.

 

The third and fourth roles for government grew out of the experiences of
the 1930s and the Great Depression. John M. Keynes said that the
government should attempt to reduce the swings in economic activity and
keep the economy as close to full employment as possible. Unemployment
rates would be kept at its natural rate and inflation should remain low.
The economy can then avoid the cost of excessive unemployment or
inflation. The government has two basic tools to carry out these
policies, monetary and fiscal policy.

 

Adam Smith was aware of the less fortunate people in capitalist society.
He knew that some people would not be able to grab his/her share in the
wealth pool created in capitalist society. Based on the Christian
morality, he argued that charity was an important principle to be
followed in any market society. He felt that society, as a whole would
be better off knowing that everyone was looked after. During the 1930s
and the Great Depression, it became clear that churches and local
governments and the other civic-minded organizations could not provide
sufficient money to the truly needy of the day. Keynes then argued that
to rescue the economy from the danger of Depression, the government
expenditure must be increased. Because of this change in the line of
thinking of the economists, the government created a number of income
support programs, such as welfare, the pension plans and progressive tax
systems to redistribute income. (These income security programs are
collectively called ‘transfer payments’) This new role for
government is sometimes referred to as the ‘welfare state’.

But we should recognize that government has no resources of its own. The
members of the government are not spending their own money for these
‘welfare’ programs. Furthermore, there is no Tooth Fairy or Santa
Claus who gives them the resources. The only way the government can give
one single unit of money is to confiscate it first, under intimidation,
threats, and physical force, from one of its citizens. In other words,
for the government to do good it must first do evil. If a private person
were to do the things that a government does, he would be condemned as a
common thief. The only difference is legality, but legality alone is no
talisman for moral people. We have stated earlier about this special
power of the government (according to Russell, the basic difference
between any private firm and the government) and somewhat unwillingly
accepted its provision. 

It is often romanticized that the presence of an all-powerful government
is the price we pay for civilisation. I feel it is but the opposite :
The presence of government is the price we pay for lack of civilisation.
Some thinkers have grown disgusted with the oppressive tendencies of
governments, and have suggested that freedom can only be secured if
there are no governments. These anarchists fail to consider the
oppressive nature of men. Without governmental restraint, men, perched
higher in the social ladder, may easily regress into violating the
other’s liberty. James Madison said, “If men were angels, no
government would be necessary.” Since we lack shiny wings and white
hearts, the presence of government is rather essential for human
society. Then the crucial question is : How much power? 

Obviously, a government must not become overtly powerful, or it will
defeat its own defined purpose. History has showed that government
always tends toward totalitarianism, growing like a poisonous weed
unless kept in check. In fact, the purpose of constitutions, charters,
and bills of rights is to help maintain the fragile balance of the
authorities that constitutes the freedom. By far the greatest check upon
government is the power of the people. Since civil government is nothing
more than the united power of the people, the members of a society have
the power to overturn the government if it ever grew to demolish the
order of the society. Even in a tyranny the united power of the people
is present, but instead of being in the possession of the people that
power is hijacked by the tyrant. 

Then how much power should bestow upon the people? If the amount is
large, the government will become unduly weak, if the amount is small,
little time will take for evolution of a highly authoritative
government.

In fact the above question is rather simple to answer theoretically :
The people should possess exactly that optimum amount of power that
would neither threaten the individual to do something against his/her
will to comply with the society, nor would expose the society under the
threat of one individual who wishes to use the collective will for
his/her own end. In philosophical terms, the people gets to own only
that amount of power that would allow them to obtain the perfect harmony
between their individual and collective selves. 

The tyranny of the self-proclaimed ruler over the subjects and the
tyranny of the majority over the individual, are but the different forms
of the same tendency of oppression deep-rooted in human psyche. It is
necessary for the government to wander far from these two familiar but
perilous traps.

The History shows us crystal-clearly that it is not that easy to
optimize the distribution of power according to the above stated
criterions. In fact, it is as hard as it gets and a bit more than that.
So how can it be done? How that almost-utopic harmony can be arrived at
when a person will be able not only to comply with but to actually
enhance the community, not sacrificing his/her individuality?  

I feel this essentially is the challenge of the government. This is the
role of the government in society – to create such a living
environment where both the society and the individual are free from the
fear of each other’s attempts of encroachment of the other’s region
of freedom, and where the constant presence of both the entities
enriches the other and where the same happens between the societies and
the individuals themselves. The role is not easy (in fact there exists
none definitive guides on how to play it), but the word ‘easy’ was
not there in the job description.

N.B. : I will define the word ‘power’ as something, possession of
which by an individual, prompts the society to sincerely consider
his/her views about issues on which collective decisions have been taken
or will be taken, and vice versa.
