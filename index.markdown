This is my public wiki, hosted at [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). These are mostly notes and unpolished thoughts that I have and think other people might find helpful. They will probably change considerably over time.  If you're looking for something more permanent, check out my weblog at [The ByteBaker](http://bytebaker.com).

The sections currently being edited are listed below. Most of these probably have other pages under them.

+ [Programming languages Resources](/prog-lang-resources)
+ [Debates](/debates)
